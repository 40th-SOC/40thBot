## How to setup

To setup the bot I made it as simple as possible. I now created a [config.py](config.py) file where you can put the needed things to edit.

Here is an explanation of what everything is:

| Variable          | What it is                                                            |
| ------------------| ----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| BOT_PREFIX        | The prefix(es) of your bot                                            |
| TOKEN             | The token of your bot                                                 |
| APPLICATION_ID    | The application ID of your bot                                        |
| OWNERS            | The user ID of all the bot owners                                     |
| BLACKLIST         | The user ID of all the users who can't use the bot                    |
| STARTUP_COGS      | The cogs that should be automatically loaded when you start the bot   |

## How to start

To start the bot you simply need to launch, either your terminal (Linux, Mac & Windows) or your Command Prompt (Windows).

If you have multiple versions of python installed (2.x and 3.x) then you will need to use the following command:
```
python3 bot.py
```
